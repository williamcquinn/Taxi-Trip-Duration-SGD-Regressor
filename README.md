# Taxi-Trip-Duration-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent
In this repository predictive modeling is used to forecast taxi trip duration in the city of Chicago, factoring in variables such as the day of week, time of day, departure point, and destination. To accomplish this, a dataset of taxi trip records from 2018 has been used to train a variety of predictive models, to be tested on a dataset composed of the first month of records from 2019. To evaluate model efficiency, the metrics of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) have been implemented. Modeling algorithms, such as linear regression, XGBoost and Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor, were used and the Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor was chosen as the final model due to its exceptionally low MSE and MAE, in comparison to the alternative models.
